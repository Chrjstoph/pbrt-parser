PBRT-Parser
===========

This is just a toy-project of mine, in order to be able to
(eventually) parse the PBRT file format and convert PBRT scenes to
some of the other formats my other software (e.g., ospray) can also
read.

I'll be working on this on and off in my spare time; right now this is
little more than a few early steps.
